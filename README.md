# RhythmGameforPython
A Rhythm Game for Python made with pygame only. 


This code plays music and generates patterns that user created. This program is for those who want to insert one's favorite song and design own chart patterns!


Chart builder is in progress so stay tuned!

<br><br>

Currently, Song chart patterns are generated by while loop... hence it is not that fun. (In progress...)


But you can go modify the files ('chart_[songname].py') to make them more playable!!!

<br><br>

Future plan: Going to add machine learning for auto-generating song charts (song patterns) given a song.


Develope period: 9/20/2021 ~ 9/24/2021 on holidays
